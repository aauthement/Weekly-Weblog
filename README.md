# Blog Week #4
The readings assigned for this week reflected many different ideas of how influential and powerful the media can be. Bowker and Star present to us how the categorizing people into groups can be beneficial and detrimental at the same time. The reading mainly focused on the classification process. “The advantaged are those whose place in a set of classification systems is a powerful one and for whom powerful sets of classifications of knowledge appear natural. For these people the infrastructures that together support and construct their identities operate particularly smoothly (though never fully so). For others, the fitting process of being able to use the infrastructures takes a terrible toll. To "act naturally," they have to reclassify and be reclassified socially.” (Bowker, p. 225). The authors kept explaining that classifying people in groups were easier to control because it gave them a sense of belonging and identity. People actually want to associate with groups too because the psychological effect ends up turning the individual more confident. The more I think about it, although it creates division, it also forms a sort of unity.
The next reading introduced me to the idea of posthuman innovation and possibilities. Many arguments and problems come with this, but Hayles explains the solution to these problems in “How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetic, Literature, and Informatics.” I like how Hayles explains the relationship between human interaction and environment in a psychological point of view. To tie in with Bowker’s article, the idea of identity is very emphasized again. “Such an argument assumes a vision of the human in which conscious agency is the essence of human identity. Sacrifice this, and we humans are hopelessly compromised, contaminated with mechanic alienness in the very heart of our humanity.” (Hayles. p. 288). Hayles not only explains the solution, but also offers the other side of the argument to make this topic very debatable.
Design X focuses on sociotechnical systems to help better our society and economy. This article gives us proposals of how to fix the problems Design X presents. Designers must understand the problem, develop proposals very delicately and carefully, share with other colleagues, and put together an organized and structured plan. The main step that is emphasized is implementation. “In order to make changes, designers cannot sit outside the sociotechnical system and throw solutions over the fence. Rather, they have to engage with the social dynamic of sensemaking within the organization; they have to negotiate with multiple stakeholders; and they have to be satisfied with the incremental changes that typically result from such processes. Thus, it is not sufficient for designers to be skilled with respect to the classical design arts. Designers who expect to make an impact at the level of socio- technical systems will also have to be skilled in the politics of muddling through.” (Norman and Stappers, p. 98). This complicated process is years of research and development that can better our future.
Finally, to me, the most compelling and scariest part of the media is surveillance capitalism, and this is perfectly explained to us in the video Forum Privatheit 2018: Shoshana Zuboff Keynote Speech on Surveillance Capitalism. This speech gives us an idea of the essential meaning of this form of capitalism. Corporate America is starving for any type or form of data they can get their hands on. This made me realize how important of an issue this is because most people have a clue of what this is. “You are not the product, you are the abandoned carcass. The product derives from the surplus that is ripped from your life.” (Privatheit, 9:40). This quote excellently represents an average human being getting ripped from his or her personal information. We are a society that relies heavily on technology, but with this advancement comes many problems. We must be more aware of what this brings to the table. Every word, text, or action done can be tracked easily, and we must be aware of this to protect our own privacy. This corporate takeover of the media can essentially control the way we think and act.
